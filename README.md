# PatternsInBiology-DeepLearning
Finding hidden patterns in biology with deep learning approaches 

We will use deeplearning algorithms to find interesting (biologically) patterns and mechanisms in biological phenomena in species across the kingdoms.

In this notebook, we will use deeplearning in feedforward neural networks to detect unperturbed wildtype samples from whole seedling tissues of _Arabidopsis thaliana_
